# School District Analysis

## Overview Analysis School District 

The school district has requested a preview of different key metrics by school campus and refine by district level.
With this perspective the following project intend to show a clear analysis focused on Math performance and Reading scores disassembling several different ways for display data in order to help on decisions for the upcoming boar meeting. After a deeper look into the data the school board have requested more information on Thomas High School specifically for the 9th grade once there was some doubt about legitimacy of grades. Further on the data was separated and investigated in different perspectives.

## Results

*  District Summary Repercussion 

In order to have a closer look to verify and assure the grades scores for 9th grades, the data was cleaned after identifying null data information, from that it was compared the metric of percentages of math grades passing, reading passing and overall passing. 
As we can observe on the charts below when comparing the data, we had pull 461 tests that had null data. From this information we can assume that the difference before the data changes was minimum, representing less than 1% of the totals.

After exanimating the original data, the Thomas High School was placed at 91% overall passing rate, which raised some doubts about the legitimacy of the data information. Further on the total number of 10th and 12th graders was redirected as denominator and the data was adjusted.
On the charts below we can see that removing the 9th grade students the data set had change considerably, with a descending overall passage from 91% to 65%.
